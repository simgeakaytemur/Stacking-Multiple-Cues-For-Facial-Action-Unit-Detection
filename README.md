# Stacking-Multiple-Cues-For-Facial-Action-Unit-Detection
This repository provides the codes for the â€œStacking Multiple Cues For Facial Action Unit Detection". This code aims to develop a deep learning based stacking scheme to detect facial Action Units (AU) in video data. Given a sequence of video frames, it combines multiple cues extracted from the AU detectors employing in frame, segment, and transition levels. This implementation is based on TFLearn Toolbox that is is a modular and transparent deep learning library built on top of Tensorflow.
